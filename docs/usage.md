There are quite a few tools in the Babel toolchain that try to make it easy for you to use Babel whether you're an "end-user" or building an integration of Babel itself. This will be a quick introduction to those tools and you can read more about them in the "Usage" section of the docs.

> If you're using a framework, the work of configuring Babel might be different or actually already handled for you. Check out our [interactive setup guide](/setup.html) instead.

## Overview

This guide will show you how to compile your JavaScript application code that uses ES2015+ syntax into code that works in current browsers. That will involve both transforming new syntax and polyfilling missing features.

The entire process to set this up involves:

1. Running these commands to install the packages:

   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
   npm install --save core-js@3 regenerator-runtime
   ```

2. Creating a config file named `babel.config.json` (requires `v7.8.0` and above) in the root of your project with this content:

   ```json
   {
     "presets": [
       [
         "@babel/env",
         {
           "targets": {
             "edge": "17",
             "firefox": "60",
             "chrome": "67",
             "safari": "11.1",
           },
           "useBuiltIns": "usage",
           "corejs": "3.6.5",
         }
       ]
     ]
   }
   ```

   > The browsers list above is just an arbitrary example. You will have to adapt it for the browsers you want to support.

Or `babel.config.js` if you are using an older Babel version

   ```js
   const presets = [
     [
       "@babel/env",
       {
         targets: {
           edge: "17",
           firefox: "60",
           chrome: "67",
           safari: "11.1",
         },
         useBuiltIns: "usage",
         "corejs": "3.6.4",
       },
     ],
   ];

   module.exports = { presets };
   ```

3. And running this command to compile all your code from the `src` directory to `lib`:

   ```sh
   ./node_modules/.bin/babel src --out-dir lib
   ```

   > You can use the npm package runner that comes with npm@5.2.0 to shorten that command by replacing `./node_modules/.bin/babel` with `npx babel`

Read on for a step-by-step explanation of how this works and an introduction to each of the tools used.

## Basic usage with CLI

All the Babel modules you'll need are published as separate npm packages scoped under `@babel` (since version 7). This modular design allows for various tools each designed for a specific use case. Here we'll look at `@babel/core` and `@babel/cli`.

### Core Library

The core functionality of Babel resides at the [@babel/core](core.md) module. After installing it:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @babel/core
```

you can `require` it directly in your JavaScript program and use it like this:

```js
const babel = require("@babel/core");

babel.transform("code", optionsObject);
```

As an end-user though, you'll probably want to install other tools that serve as an interface to `@babel/core` and integrate well with your development process. Even so, you might still want to check its documentation page to learn about the options, most of which can be set from the other tools as well.

### CLI tool

[@babel/cli](cli.md) is a tool that allows you to use babel from the terminal. Here's the installation command and a basic usage example:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli

./node_modules/.bin/babel src --out-dir lib
```

This will parse all the JavaScript files in the `src` directory, apply any transformations we have told it to, and output each file to the `lib` directory. Since we haven't told it to apply any transformations yet, the output code will be identical to the input (exact code styling is not preserved). We can specify what transformations we want by passing them as options.

We used the `--out-dir` option above. You can view the rest of the options accepted by the cli tool by running it with `--help`. But the most important to us right now are `--plugins` and `--presets`.

## Plugins & Presets

Transformations come in the form of plugins, which are small JavaScript programs that instruct Babel on how to carry out transformations to the code. You can even write your own plugins to apply any transformations you want to your code. To transform ES2015+ syntax into ES5 we can rely on official plugins like `@babel/plugin-transform-arrow-functions`:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-transform-arrow-functions

./node_modules/.bin/babel src --out-dir lib --plugins=@babel/plugin-transform-arrow-functions
```

Now any arrow functions in our code will be transformed into ES5 compatible function expressions:

```js
const fn = () => 1;

// converted to

var fn = function fn() {
  return 1;
};
```

That's a good start! But we also have other ES2015+ features in our code that we want transformed. Instead of adding all the plugins we want one by one, we can use a "preset" which is just a pre-determined set of plugins.

Just like with plugins, you can create your own presets too to share any combination of plugins you need. For our use case here, there's an excellent preset named `env`.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env

./node_modules/.bin/babel src --out-dir lib --presets=@babel/env
```

Without any configuration, this preset will include all plugins to support modern JavaScript (ES2015, ES2016, etc.). But presets can take options too. Rather than passing both cli and preset options from the terminal, let's look at another way of passing options: configuration files.

## Configuration

> There are a few different ways to use configuration files depending on your needs. Be sure to read our in-depth guide on how to [configure Babel](configuration.md) for more information.

For now, let's create a file called `babel.config.json` (requires `v7.8.0` and above) with the following content:

```json
{
"presets": [
  [
  "@babel/env",
    {
      "targets": {
        "edge": "17",
        "firefox": "60",
        "chrome": "67",
        "safari": "11.1"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Now the `env` preset will only load transformation plugins for features that are not available in our target browsers. We're all set for syntax. Let's look at polyfills next.

## Polyfill

> ðŸš¨ As of Babel 7.4.0, [`@babel/polyfill`](polyfill.md) was deprecated in favor of directly including `core-js/stable` (to polyfill ECMAScript features) and [`regenerator-runtime/runtime`](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/blob/master/packages/regenerator-runtime/runtime.js) (needed to use transpiled generator functions).

Polyfills allow new "built-ins" of modern JS specs to be understood by older runtime environments. Built-ins like `Promise` or `WeakMap`, static methods like `Array.from` or `Object.assign`, instance methods like `Array.prototype.includes`, and generator functions (when used alongside the regenerator plugin) won't necessarily work in all environments such as an older browser.

You install two packages to provide polyfills. Make sure you have installed both as dependencies needed to run your source code.

```sh
npm install --save core-js regenerator-runtime
```

Importing these two modules at the entrypoint to your JS application will allow emulating a full ES2015+ environment.

```js
import "core-js/stable";
import "regenerator-runtime/runtime";
```

However, doing so imports all the polyfills, and you may not want *everything*.

When using the `@babel/present-env` preset, you can configure a [`"useBuiltIns"` option](preset-env.md#usebuiltins) to only include the polyfills you need. With this new option the configuration changes like this:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "edge": "17",
          "firefox": "60",
          "chrome": "67",
          "safari": "11.1",
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "usage",
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Babel will now inspect all your code for features that are missing in your target environments and include only the required polyfills. For example this code:

```js
Promise.resolve().finally();
```

would turn into this (because Edge 17 doesn't have `Promise.prototype.finally`):

```js
require("core-js/modules/es.promise.finally");

Promise.resolve().finally();
```

If you're not using the `env` preset, you can use the [transform runtime](plugin-transform-runtime.md) to avoid polluting the global scope. Or, if you prefer a manual approach and know what features you need to polyfill, you can import them directly from [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#commonjs).

## Summary

We used `@babel/cli` to run Babel from the terminal, `core-js` and `regenerator-runtime` to polyfill new JavaScript features, and the `env` preset to only include the transformations and polyfills for the features that we use and that are missing in our target browsers.
