<blockquote class="babel-callout babel-callout-warning">
  <h4>Decorators are not currently supported</h4>
  <p>
    Decorators are disabled in Babel v6, pending a proposal update â€“ see <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/2645">babel/babel#2645</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Until Babel officially supports decorators again, you might want to try the third-party <a href="https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy">transform-decorators-legacy</a> plugin, or use Babel v5.
