# Babylon is now [moved into the main Babel mono-repo](https://github.com/babel/website/tree/master/docs/parser.md) `babel-parser`.

The move makes it much easier to release and develop in sync with the rest of Babel!

## Check out the 6.x README [here](https://github.com/babel/babylon/blob/6.x/README.md)
