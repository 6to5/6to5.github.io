The first release of the year! :tada: 

Babel 7.8.0 supports the new [ECMAScript 2020](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md) features by default: you don't need to enable individual plugins for nullish coalescing (`??`), optional chaining (`?.`) and dynamic `import()` anymore with preset-env.

We also finished unifying our different configuration formats, a process that we started in the [7.7.0 release](https://babeljs.io/blog/2019/11/05/7.7.0#new-configuration-file-extensions-10501-https-githubcom-babel-babel-pull-10501-10599-https-githubcom-babel-babel-pull-10599).

Lastly, Babel's CLI now supports two new options: `--out-file-extension` and `--copy-ignored`.

You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.8.0).

If you or your company wants to support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can donate to us on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/babel) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users. Reach out at [team@babeljs.io](mailto:team@babeljs.io) if you'd like to discuss more!

## Highlights

### ECMAScript 2020 default support ([#10811](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10811), [#10817](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10817), [#10819](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10819), [#10843](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10843))

During the last [meeting](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/master/2019/12.md), TC39 approved to Stage 4 both the nullish coalescing and optional chaining proposals!

The nullish coalescing operator allows you to provide a fallback value when an expression evaluates to `null` or `undefined`:

```javascript
const name = person.fullName ?? "Anonymous";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

This is similar to how the logical OR (`||`) operator works. The difference is that while `||` checks for "falsy" values (i.e. `undefined`, `null`, `false`, `0`, `0n` and `""`), `??` only checks for "nullish" values. This better matches the "value not provided" mental model, and works better with possibly falsy, but valid, values:

```javascript
const element = { index: 0, value: "foo" };

const index = element.index ?? -1; //  0 :D
const index = element.index || -1; // -1 :(
```

The optional chaining proposal uses the same concept of "nullish values", allowing optional property accesses on values which could be nullish. It also supports optional function calls and computed properties.

```javascript
const city = person.address?.city; // person.address could be not defined
const isNeighbor = person.address?.isCloseTo(me);

person.sayHayUsing?.("Twitter"); // The person.sayHayUsing method could be not defined 
```

You can now safely use these new features in your code! If you are already using `@babel/preset-env`, you can use these two operators and they will be compiled based on your targets, just like any other ECMAScript feature. If you were using the `@babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator` or `@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining` directly, you can remove them from your config:

```diff
{
  "presets": [
    ["@babel/env", { "targets": ["last 2 versions"] }]
  ],
  "plugins": [
-   "@babel/proposal-optional-chaining",
-   "@babel/proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator"
  ] 
}
```

These features are now also enabled by default in `@babel/parser`: if you were using it directly, you can remove the `nullishCoalescingOperator` and `optionalChaining` parser plugins. We also enabled parsing for dynamic `import()` (which has been included in `@babel/preset-env` since [v7.5.0](https://babeljs.io/blog/2019/07/03/7.5.0#dynamic-import-9552-https-githubcom-babel-babel-pull-9552-and-10109-https-githubcom-babel-babel-pull-10109)), so you can safely remove the `dynamicImport` plugin.

### Support every configuration file extension ([#10783](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10783) and [#10903](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10903))

Babel 6 supported a single, JSON-based, configuration file: `.babelrc`.

In Babel 7.0.0, we introduced `babel.config.js` (which has [different resolution logic](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files)) and `.babelrc.js`. JavaScript config files can be useful for scenarios needing higher flexibility. This was the situation:

<div style="margin: auto;width: fit-content;">

| **Node.js file type** | **babel.config.__** | **.babelrc.__** |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|
| `.js`                 | ✔️ Supported         | ✔️ Supported  |
| `.json`               | ❌ Not supported    | ❔ Supported, with implicit extension |
</div>

> ℹ️ We strongly recommend reading about the differences between [`babel.config.*` and `.babelrc.*`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files)!

Then Node.js 13.2.0 come out, with support for native ECMAScript module, and for the `.cjs` and `.mjs` extensions. In Babel 7.7.0 we added support for `.cjs` config files to allow users enabling `"type": "module"` in their `package.json` without breaking Babel, as well as support for `babel.config.json`, to allow static project-wide configuration. 

<div style="margin: auto;width: fit-content;">

| **Node.js file type** | **babel.config.__** | **.babelrc.__** |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|
| `.js`                 | ✔️ Supported when `"type": "module"` is not enabled | ✔️ Supported when `"type": "module"` is not enabled  |
| `.json`               | ✔️ Supported         | ❔ Supported, with implicit extension |
| `.cjs`                | ✔️ Supported         | ✔️ Supported  |
| `.mjs`                | ❌ Not supported    | ❌ Not supported |
</div>

This release aligns Babel with the file types natively supported by Node.js, by allowing `.babelrc.json`, `babel.config.mjs`, and `.babelrc.mjs`.

<div style="margin: auto;width: fit-content;">

| **Node.js file type** | **babel.config.__** | **.babelrc.__** |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|
| `.js`                 | ✔️ Supported         | ✔️ Supported  |
| `.json`               | ✔️ Supported         | ✔️ Supported  |
| `.cjs`                | ✔️ Supported         | ✔️ Supported  |
| `.mjs`                | ✔️ Supported         | ✔️ Supported  |
</div>

Please remember that ECMAScript modules are **asynchronous**: that's why, for example, you can't `require()` them but have to use `import()` which returns a promise.
For this reasons, they can only be used when calling Babel via the promise-based or callback-based entry points. They already work with `@babel/cli`, `babel-loader` and `gulp-babel`, and they will work with the next release of `rollup-plugin-babel`. They are not supported by `babel-eslint` yet.

### New CLI options ([#9144](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/9144) and [#10887](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10887))

We added two new flags to `@babel/cli`: `--copy-ignored` and `--out-file-extension`.

`--copy-ignored` can be used to copy files which are not transpiled by Babel either because they are ignored using the `--ignore` CLI option, or because `"ignore"` is set in a configuration file.

This is similar to how the `--copy-files` option works, but `--copy-files` is meant to copy anything which is not transpiled because is not a JavaScript file (for example, `.css` or `.json`), rather than explicitly ignored files.

`--out-file-extension` can be used to configure the extension of the generated files. For example, if you are transpiling `.js` files containing native ECMAScript modules in Node.js and you want to generate CommonJS files, you might need to use the `.cjs` extension depending on your `package.json` options:

```bash
$ babel src --out-dir lib-cjs --out-file-extension cjs
```

### Preparing for Babel 8

We are starting to work on the Babel 8.0.0 release in our umbrella issue: [#10746](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10746).

Babel 8 will only contain breaking changes: we will release a minor version the same day, containing all the bug fixes and new features that would otherwise be released in 8.0.0.

While we don't intend for this release to a require a huge migration path, below are two situations which may call for your attention.

#### Extract targets parser and compat data from preset-env ([#10899](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10899))

Different presets out there are using `@babel/preset-env`'s internal logic to parse compilation targets or to retrieve information about the necessary plugins and polyfills.

We have decided to officially support these two use cases, by providing two new public packages:
- `@babel/helper-compilation-targets`, which exports a function to normalize the specified targets and a few other related utilities:
  ```javascript
  import getTargets from "@babel/helper-compilation-targets";
  
  getTargets({
    browsers: ["last 2 chrome versions"],
    node: 10
  }) == {
    chrome: "77.0.0",
    node: "10.0.0"
  }
  ```
- `@babel/compat-data`, which contains a bunch of JSON files where we store all the browsers versions for which each plugin or `core-js@2` polyfill is required. It's mostly generated from [`compat-table`](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/), but we might add some new data in the future.
  If you need data for `core-js@3` polyfills, you can use [`core-js-compat`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-js-compat).

We plan to disallow using internal files starting from Babel 8. If you are relying on other internal APIs, please let us know!

#### Introduce opt-in stricter AST validation ([#10917](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10917))

`@babel/types` already performs many checks to ensure that the AST you are building is valid. For example, this code will throw because you can't use a statement in place of an expression:

```javascript
// foo = if (true) {}

t.assignmentExpression(
  "=",
  t.identifier("foo"),
  t.ifStatement(t.booleanLiteral(true), t.blockStatement([]))
);
```

We are introducing stricter validation to prevent even more invalid ASTs: not only from a tree shape point of view but also ensuring that nodes in the correct position carry valid information. For example, starting from Babel 8 `t.identifier("123")` will be disallowed, because `123` is not a valid identifier.

We can't enable these checks in Babel 7.8.0 because the risk of breaking existing plugins is too high, but we highly encourage you to enable these stricter checks using the `BABEL_TYPES_8_BREAKING=true` environment variable and open issues (or better, PRs!) to fix the plugins that you are using which won't work with Babel 8.
