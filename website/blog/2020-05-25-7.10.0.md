We just released a new minor version of Babel!

This 7.10 release includes:
- Full support for the new `#prop in obj` checks for private fields [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-fields-in-in) (`class A { #a = 1 }`).
- `@babel/preset-env` now compiles ES2015-style Unicode escapes (`\u{Babe1}`) to the equivalent legacy syntax (`\uDAAA\uDFE1`).
- Two improvements to the [Optional Chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining) operator (`?.`)
- Parser support for the new [Module Attributes proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-module-attributes) (`import a from "./a.json" with type: "json"`).
- Better tree-shaking support for React code (i.e. `React.memo`)!
- Setting up [RFCs](https://github.com/babel/rfcs) repo and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/babel/babel/discussions) pages!

You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.10.0).

<!-- truncate -->

Alongside this Babel release, we are releasing the first experimental version of our new [polyfills compatibility architecture](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills) (see below for more details) thanks to [Nicol√≤](https://twitter.com/NicoloRibaudo) and some awesome folks in the community! We began discussions about this over a year ago in a [RFC issue](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10008) within the Babel repository.

As an aside, we now have an official RFC process for discussing changes that significantly impact our users: please check it out over in the [`babel/rfcs`](https://github.com/babel/rfcs) repository! In addition, we've enabled [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/babel/babel/discussions) on our repository if you have feedback or questions!

If you or your company want to support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can donate to us on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/babel) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users. Reach out at [team@babeljs.io](mailto:team@babeljs.io) if you'd like to discuss more!

## Highlights

### New features enabled by default

Now that it has reached Stage 4, parsing for [`import.meta`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-meta) is enabled by default. Please note that `@babel/preset-env` doesn't support transforming it, because what that object contains is up to the engine and is not defined in the ECMAScript specification.

```javascript
console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/my-module.js" }
```

We also discovered that we didn't have support for compiling a 5-year-old ECMAScript feature: `\u{...}`-style Unicode escapes! Thanks to [Justin](https://github.com/jridgewell), `@babel/preset-env` can now compile them in strings and identifiers by default.

```javascript
var \u{1d49c} = "\u{Babe1}";
console.log(\u{1d49c});
```

```javascript
var _ud835_udc9c = "\uDAAA\uDFE1";
console.log(_ud835_udc9c);
```

Lastly, we have added `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties` and `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods` to the [`shippedProposals`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#shippedproposals) option of `@babel/preset-env`. These proposals are not Stage 4 (i.e. part of the ECMAScript standard) yet, but they are already enabled by default in [many JavaScript engines](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields#implementations).

If you aren't familiar:

```javascript
class Bork {
  // Public Fields
  instanceProperty = "bork";
  // Static Fields
  static staticProperty = "babelIsCool";
  // Private Fields
  #x = 0;
  a() {
    this.#x++;
  }
  
  // Private methods
  get #x() { return this.#xValue; }
  set #x(value) {
    this.#xValue = value;
    window.requestAnimationFrame(
      this.#render.bind(this));
  }
  #clicked() {
    this.#x++;
  }
}
```

### Improved optional chaining `?.` ergonomics ([#10961](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10961), [#11248](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/11248))

In [TypeScript 3.9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-9/), the interaction between non-null assertions (postfix `!`) and optional chaining [has been changed](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-9.html#parsing-differences-in-optional-chaining-and-non-null-assertions) to make it more useful.

```ts
foo?.bar!.baz
```

In TypeScript 3.8 and Babel 7.9, the above would be read as `(foo?.bar)!.baz`: "If `foo` is not nullish, get `.bar` from it. Then trust that `foo?.bar` is never nullish and always get `.bar` from it". This means that when `foo` is nullish that code would always throw, because we are trying to get `.baz` from `undefined`.

In TypeScript 3.9 and Babel 7.10, the code behaves similarly to `foo?.bar.baz`: "If `foo` is not nullish, get `.bar.baz` from it and trust me that `foo?.bar` isn't nullish".

---

Additionally, the class fields proposal [recently added support](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/pull/301) for mixing optional chaining `?.` with private fields. This means that the following code is now valid:

```js
obj?.property.#priv;
obj?.#priv;
```

Note that in the second example, if `obj` is not nullish and does not have the `#priv` field, it would still throw an error (exactly as `obj.#priv` would throw). You can read the next section to see how to avoid it!

### Private Fields in `in` ([#11372](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/11372))

```js
class Person {
  #name;
  
  hug(other) {
    if (#name in other) console.log(`${this.#name} ü§ó {other.#name}`);
    else console.log("It's not a person!")
  }
}
```

This Stage 1 proposal allows you to statically check if a given object has a specific private field.

Private fields have a built-in "brand check": if you try to access them in an object where they aren't defined, it will throw an exception. You can detect undefined private fields by leveraging this behavior with a `try`/`catch` statement, but this proposal gives us a more compact and robust syntax to do so.

You can read more about it in the [proposal's description](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-fields-in-in/blob/master/README.md).

You can test this proposal by installing the `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object` plugin and adding it to your Babel config.

### Module Attributes parser support ([#10962](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10962))

The Modules Attributes proposal allows providing the engine, module loader or bundler some additional information about the imported file. For example, you could explicitly specify that it should be parsed as JSON:

```js
import metadata from "./package.json" with type: "json";
```

Additionally, they can also be used with dynamic `import()`. Note the support for trailing commas to make it easier to add or remove the second parameter!
```js
const metadata = await import(
  "./package.json",
  { with: { type: "json" } },
);
```

Thanks to [Vivek](https://twitter.com/VivekNayyar09/), Babel now supports parsing these attributes: you can add the `@babel/plugin-syntax-module-attributes` plugin to your Babel config or, if you are using `@babel/parser` directly, you can enable the `moduleAttributes` plugin. Currently, we only accept the `type` attribute but we might relax this restriction in the future depending on how the proposal evolves.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Babel doesn't _transform_ these attributes, and they should be handled directly by your bundler or a custom plugin. We are also [discussing](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node/issues/92) whether or not this should be handled by `@babel/plugin-transform-dynamic-import`.

### Better tree-shaking for React components ([#11428](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/11428))

React exposes [many](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/97f0b7c4a0589cf3cf1dae62fb09d1b7f1253829/packages/babel-plugin-transform-react-pure-annotations/src/index.js#L10) pure functions used to annotate or wrap elements, for example `React.forwardRef`, `React.memo` or `React.lazy`. However, minifiers and bundlers aren't aware that these functions are pure and thus they cannot remove them.

Thanks to [Devon](https://twitter.com/devongovett) from the Parcel team, `@babel/preset-react` now injects `/*#__PURE__*/` annotations in those functions calls to mark them as being safe to be tree-shaken away. We had only previously done this with JSX itself (`<a></a>` => `/*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("a", null)`) 

```javascript
import React from 'react';
const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));
```

```javascript
import React from 'react';
const SomeComponent = /*#__PURE__*/React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));
```

### New experimental polyfills architecture ([#10008](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10008), [`babel-polyfills`](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills))

In the last three years, `@babel/preset-env` has shown its full potential in reducing bundle sizes not only by not transpiling supported syntax features, but also by not including unnecessary `core-js` polyfills.
Currently Babel has three different ways to inject `core-js` polyfills in the source code:
- By using `@babel/preset-env`'s `useBuiltIns: "entry"` option, it is possible to inject polyfills for every ECMAScript functionality not natively supported by the target browsers;
- By using `useBuiltIns: "usage"`, Babel will only inject polyfills for unsupported ECMAScript features but _only_ if they are actually used in the input souce code;
- By using `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`, Babel will inject po<i>n</i>yfills (which are "pure" and don't pollute the global scope) for every used ECMAScript feature supported by `core-js`. This is usually used by library authors.

Our position in the JavaScript ecosystem allows us to push these optimizations even further. `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` has big advantages for some users over `useBuiltIns`, but it doesn't consider target environments: it's 2020 and probably very few people need to load an `Array.prototype.forEach` polyfill.
Additionally, why should we limit this ability to automatically inject only the necessary polyfill to `core-js`? There are also DOM polyfills, Intl polyfills, and polyfills for a myriad of other web platform APIs. Additionally, not everyone wants to use `core-js`: there are many other valid ECMAScript polyfills, which have different tradeoffs (e.g. source size vs spec compliancy) and may work better for some of you. For example, we are actively working on an [**`es-shims`**](https://github.com/es-shims/) integration.

What if the logic to inject them was not related to the actual data about the available or required polyfills, so that they can be used and developed independently?

We are now releasing the first experimental version of four new packages: [`babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills/blob/master/packages/babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator/README.md), [`babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills/blob/master/packages/babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2/README.md), [`babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills/blob/master/packages/babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3/README.md) and [`babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills/blob/master/packages/babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims/README.md).

These packages all support injecting polyfills both modifying the engine built-ins and by directly importing them without polluting the global scope, as well as also injecting only the polyfills needed only by your browsers.

We are also releasing [`@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills/blob/master/packages/babel-helper-define-polyfill-provider/README.md): a new helper package which makes it possible for polyfill authors or users to define _their own_ polyfill provider plugins, 

Thanks [Jordan](https://twitter.com/ljharb) for working with [Nicol√≤](https://twitter.com/NicoloRibaudo) to make it possible to build the [**`es-shims`**](https://github.com/es-shims/) plugin!

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want to read more about these packages, and learn how to setup them, you can check out the project's [`README`](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills/blob/master/README.md).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These packages are still experimental. We would appreciate feedback about them either on Twitter or on GitHub, but they are not ready for production yet. For example, we still need to wire some polyfills, and we haven't tested the plugins in production applications yet.
