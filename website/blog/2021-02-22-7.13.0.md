---

We just published Babel 7.13.0, the first minor release of 2021!

This release includes some important features to `@babel/core`: a `targets` option (similar to `@babel/preset-env`'s one) that can be shared across different plugins, an `assumptions` option to precisely tune your configuration to produce a smaller compilation output, and support for plugins and presets written using native ECMAScript modules.

Babel now supports transforming the [Records and Tuples](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple) ECMAScript proposal, which brings immutable data structures and structural equality to JavaScript, and parsing the [Module Blocks](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-js-module-blocks) proposal.

Additionally, we added support for some new Flow and TypeScript features.

You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.12.0).

## Highlights

### Top-level `targets` option ([#12189](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12189), [RFC](https://github.com/babel/rfcs/pull/2))

`targets` is the option that made `@babel/preset-env` the most powerful preset we have ever had: it can automatically choose what syntax to transform and what polyfills to inject based on your target browsers.

However, other plugins can also benefit from knowing your targets. For example, you currently have to specify the targets twice if you are using our [new polyfill plugins](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills). With the new options you can lift it up to the top-level, specifying it only once:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Old configuration</th>
<th>New configuration</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["@babel/preset-env", {
      "targets": ">1%, not ie 11"
    }]
  ],
  "plugins": [
    ["polyfill-es-shims", {
      "targets": ">1%, not ie 11"
    }]
  ]
}
```

</td>
<td>

```json
{
  "targets": ">1%, not ie 11"
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"],
  "plugins": ["polyfill-es-shims"]
}







```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

We recommended converting configs to use the top-level `targets` option since:

1. It better handles the [`esmodules: true`](TODO: Link) target. (it's intersected with the other targets, rather than replacing them)
2. We are exploring how to use it in more plugins to generate more optimized output

You can read the details about this new option in its [RFC](TODO: Link).

> ðŸ”® In the future we might explore moving `@babel/preset-env` into `@babel/core` so that you don't have to install one additional package to get started with Babel. This new option can be seen as the first step in that direction!

### Top-level `assumptions` option ([#12219](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12219), [RFC](https://github.com/babel/rfcs/pull/5))

Many of our plugins have a `loose` option, which enables the compiler to make some assumptions about the code you are writing. It uses these to ignore certain edge cases and generate a smaller or faster output.

However, `loose` has some problems: the term itself is not really descriptive of how it affects the compiler behaivior and sometimes must be set the same across different plugins to make sure that everything is compiled correctly.

For this reason, we are introducing a new set of `assumptions` that you can set independently from the plugins you are using: a plugin can be influcenced by multiple assumptions and an assumption can influence multiple plugins.

> :warning: This is an advanced functionality. Carefully choose which assumptions you enable, because they are not spec-compliant and might break your code if violated.

For example, when transforming optional chaining and nullish coalescing, Babel will generate this output by default:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
let user, points;

let score = points ?? 0;
let name = user?.name;
```

</td>
<td>

```js
let user, points;

let score = points !== null && points !== void 0 ? points : 0;
let name = user === null || user === void 0 ? void 0 : user.name;
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

However, you can enable the `noDocumentAll` assumption to tell Babel "I'm never using the `document.all`, so you can compile without worrying about it":

```json
{
  "targets": "firefox 70",
  "assumptions": { "noDocumentAll": true },
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

<table>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
let user, points;

let score = points ?? 0;
let name = user?.name;
```

</td>
<td>

```js
let user, points;

let score = points != null ? points : 0;
let name = user == null ? void 0 : user.name;
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can read the full list of assumptions [in the documentation](https://babeljs.io/assumptions), and you can individually enable or disable them to see how they affect the compiled output.

### Records and Tuples support ([#12145](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12145))

Thanks to a collaboration with [Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/), Babel now supports transforming the "Records and Tuples" stage 2 [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple).

The Babel plugin transforms the records and tuples syntax using the global `Record` and `Tuple` functions:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
let data = #{
  name: "Babel",
  ids: #[1, 2, 3]
};
```

</td>
<td>

```js
let data = Record({
  name: "Babel",
  ids: Tuple(1, 2, 3)
});
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

This means that you will need to load a polyfill for those global functions, such as [`@bloomberg/record-tuple-polyfill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bloomberg/record-tuple-polyfill).

In order to enable this transformer, you need to add `@babel/plugin-proposal-record-and-tuple` to your configuration.

### New Flow features ([#12193](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12193), [#12234](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12234))

Babel 7.12.0 two new Flow features:

- `this` type annotation in functions, that allow you to specify the type of the `this` object as if it was a parameter

  ```js
  function getPerson(this: Database, id: string): Person {
    this instanceof Database; // true
  }
  ```

- `enum` declarations with unknown members

  ```js
  enum PetKind {
    Dog,
    Cat,
    Snake,
    ...
  }
  ```

### TypeScript 4.2 support ([#12628](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12628))

[TypeScript 4.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-2-rc/) is currently RC, and it supports some new syntax features such as abstract constructor signatures.

You can read more about the changes in [the TypeScript release post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-2-beta/).

### Automatic ES modules in `@babel/runtime` ([#12632](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12632))

`@babel/runtime` contains all the Babel runtime helpers in two different formats: CommonJS modules and ECMAScript modules.

Until now, you had to manually choose which one you wanted to use, specifying the `useESModules` option of `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`.

We have now reorganized `@babel/runtime`'s internal structure, leveraging the new [`"exports"`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_package_entry_points) `package.json` field supported by Node.js and bundlers, so that they are able to automatically choose between CJS and ESM.

For this reason, the `useESModules` option is now deprecated and will be removed in Babel 8.
