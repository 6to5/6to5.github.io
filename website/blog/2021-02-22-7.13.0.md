---

We just published Babel 7.13.0, the first minor release of 2021!

This release includes some important features to `@babel/core`: a `targets` option (similar to `@babel/preset-env`'s one) that can be shared across different plugins, an `assumptions` option to precisely tune your configuration to produce a smaller compilation output, and support for plugins and presets written using native ECMAScript modules.

Babel now supports transforming the [Records and Tuples](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple) ECMAScript proposal, which brings immutable data structures and structural equality to JavaScript, and parsing the [Module Blocks](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-js-module-blocks) proposal.

Additionally, we added support for some new Flow and TypeScript features.

You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.12.0).

## Highlights

### Top-level `targets` option ([#12189](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12189), [RFC](https://github.com/babel/rfcs/pull/2))

The `targets` option is the true power behind `@babel/preset-env`: it allows users the ability to specify their target environments which allows the preset to automatically choose which syntax to transform and what polyfills to inject.

Since releasing `@babel/preset-env`, we've learned that plugins _themselves_ can also benefit from knowing your targets. Currently, this can a bit cumbersome, since you'd have to specify your targets twice (for example, if you are using our [new polyfill plugins](https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills). By introducing `targets` as a top level option, you now only have to specify your targets once:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Old configuration</th>
<th>New configuration</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["@babel/preset-env", {
      "targets": ">1%, not ie 11"
    }]
  ],
  "plugins": [
    ["polyfill-es-shims", {
      "targets": ">1%, not ie 11"
    }]
  ]
}
```

</td>
<td>

```json
{
  "targets": ">1%, not ie 11",
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"],
  "plugins": ["polyfill-es-shims"]
}







```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

We recommended converting your Babel config to use the new top-level `targets` option since:

1. It has better handling of the [`esmodules: true`](TODO: Link) target. (it's intersected with the other targets, rather than replacing them)
2. As we introduce additional `targets`-related support in our plugins, you'll automatically benefit from more optimized output!

You can read the details about this new option in its [RFC](TODO: Link).

> ðŸ”® In the future we might explore moving `@babel/preset-env` into `@babel/core` so that you don't have to install an additional package to get started with Babel. This new option can be seen as the first step in that direction!

### Top-level `assumptions` option ([#12219](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12219), [RFC](https://github.com/babel/rfcs/pull/5))

Many of our plugins have a `loose` option, which enables Babel to generate smaller/faster output by making certain assumptions about your code and ignoring certain edge cases.

However, `loose` has some problems that lead to user frustration/confusion: the term itself does nothing to describe how it affects the compiler's behavior, and worse, sometimes it must be set the same across different plugins to ensure everything compiles.

To help fix these problems, we've added a new top level option: `assumptions`! Similar to the new `targets` option, every plugin will now receive the assumptions you've enabled, eliminating the need to set the option individually. This is really valuable since a plugin can be influenced by multiple assumptions, and an assumption can influence multiple plugins.

> :warning: This is **advanced** functionality. Please be careful when enabling assumptions, because they are _not_ spec-compliant and may break your code in unexpected ways.

For example, when transforming optional chaining and nullish coalescing, Babel will generate this output by default:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
let user, points;

let score = points ?? 0;
let name = user?.name;
```

</td>
<td>

```js
let user, points;

let score = points !== null && points !== void 0 ? points : 0;
let name = user === null || user === void 0 ? void 0 : user.name;
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

However, enabling the `noDocumentAll` assumption tells Babel "I'm never using `document.all`, so you can compile without worrying about it":

```json
{
  "targets": "firefox 70",
  "assumptions": { "noDocumentAll": true },
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

<table>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
let user, points;

let score = points ?? 0;
let name = user?.name;
```

</td>
<td>

```js
let user, points;

let score = points != null ? points : 0;
let name = user == null ? void 0 : user.name;
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Check out the full list of assumptions [over in our documentation](https://babeljs.io/assumptions), where you can individually enable or disable them to see how they affect the compiled output.

### Records and Tuples support ([#12145](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12145))

Thanks to a collaboration with [Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/), Babel now supports transforming the "Records and Tuples" stage 2 [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple).

The Babel plugin transforms the records and tuples syntax using the global `Record` and `Tuple` functions:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```js
let data = #{
  name: "Babel",
  ids: #[1, 2, 3]
};
```

</td>
<td>

```js
let data = Record({
  name: "Babel",
  ids: Tuple(1, 2, 3)
});
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

This means that you will need to load a polyfill for those global functions, such as [`@bloomberg/record-tuple-polyfill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bloomberg/record-tuple-polyfill).

In order to enable this transform, you need to add `@babel/plugin-proposal-record-and-tuple` to your configuration.

### New Flow features ([#12193](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12193), [#12234](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12234))

Babel 7.12.0 has support for two new Flow features:

- `this` type annotation in functions, that allow you to specify the type of the `this` object as if it was a parameter

  ```js
  function getPerson(this: Database, id: string): Person {
    this instanceof Database; // true
  }
  ```

- `enum` declarations with unknown members

  ```js
  enum PetKind {
    Dog,
    Cat,
    Snake,
    ...
  }
  ```

### TypeScript 4.2 support ([#12628](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12628))

[TypeScript 4.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-2-rc/) is currently RC, and it supports some new syntax features such as abstract constructor signatures.

You can read more about the changes in [the TypeScript release post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-2-beta/).

### Automatic ES modules in `@babel/runtime` ([#12632](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/12632))

`@babel/runtime` contains all of the Babel runtime helpers in both CommonJS and ECMAScript module formats.

Until now, you had to manually choose which one you wanted to use, specifying the `useESModules` option of `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`.

We have now reorganized `@babel/runtime`'s internal structure, leveraging the new [`"exports"`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_package_entry_points) `package.json` field supported by Node.js and bundlers, so that they are able to automatically choose between CJS and ESM.

For this reason, the `useESModules` option is now deprecated and will be removed in Babel 8.
