share_text: "Removing Babel's Stage Presets"
---

Moving forward with v7, we've decided it's best to stop publishing the Stage presets in Babel (e.g. `@babel/preset-stage-0`).

We didn't make this decision lightly and wanted bring show some context regarding TC39, new proposals, and Babel.

<!--truncate-->

## Some History

A Babel preset is a shareable list of plugins.

The [official Babel Stage presets](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/presets) tracked the [TC39 Staging process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) for new [syntax proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) in JavaScript.

Each preset (ex. `stage-3`, `stage-2`, etc.) included all the plugins for that particular stage and the ones above it. For example, `stage-2` included `stage-3`, and so on.

---

This allowed users who wanted to use experimental syntax to simply add the preset, instead of needing to configure/install each individual plugin.

We actually [added](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/2649) the Stage presets shortly after Babel's v6 release (it was previously a config flag in v5).

These are some older examples from Babel v6.

Itâ€™s common to see this in a config: 

```js
{
  "presets": ["es2015", "react", "stage-0"]
}
```

Original source of the package: [babel-preset-stage-0](https://unpkg.com/babel-preset-stage-0@6.0.14/index.js)

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require("babel-preset-stage-1")
  ],
  plugins: [
    require("babel-plugin-transform-do-expressions"),
    require("babel-plugin-transform-function-bind")
  ]
};
```

## Problems

These presets were a convenient way to use what we all wanted: the new, shiny, "yet-to-be-determined" future of JavaScript.

Looking back, it worked really well! (Maybe too well?)

### Too Good a Job?

Languages like [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) and tooling like [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) helped establish the idea of compiling JavaScript. Babel made it even easier to both use new/future syntax and integrate with existing tooling. The expectations changed from skepticism and worry to completely embracing the experimental.

We probably wouldn't be where we are at if not for the wide adoption of compilers such as Babel: it accelerated the usage (and teaching) of ES2015 to a much larger audience. The growth of React further fueled usage as its JSX syntax, class properties, and object rest/spread led to people knowing a bit more about these syntax proposals.

Babel became a one-time setup for people, never to be thought of again. It became underlying infrastructure, hidden behind other tooling until there was a `SyntaxError`, dependency issues, or integration issues. Simply use `stage-0`.

This was awesome to see in some ways, as it meant that these ideas were being tested in the wild, even in production environments. However, it also meant that many companies, tools, and people would encounter some trouble if a proposal happened to change in a significant way (or even get dropped altogether).

### "ES7 Decorators"

Part of issue is precisely around naming things, and as we hear often, naming things is hard.

There were a lot of names for ES6 itself: Harmony, ES Next, ES6, ES2015. When people hear about new ideas it makes sense to just pick the latest number and attach the name to it.

Thus it's easy to [search](https://twitter.com/search?q=es7%20class%20properties&src=typd) [around](https://twitter.com/search?q=es7%20decorators&src=typd) for tweets/blog posts/talks that say something like "ES7 Decorators" and find that it's become the established name for it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your reminder that binding with :: is just an experimental proposal at stage 0 and might never become a part of JS. Don&#39;t call it &quot;ES7&quot;.</p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/785082176610115584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2016</a></blockquote>

It's completely understandable that this happens without realizing it, but continuing to do so sets different expectations for how the language progresses. It's nothing to feel guilty about â€” we learn as a community and remind one another of how JavaScript works.

[Jay Phelps](https://twitter.com/_jayphelps/status/779770321003962369) wrote a nice [article](https://medium.com/@jayphelps/please-stop-referring-to-proposed-javascript-features-as-es7-cad29f9dcc4b) about this subject. He explains it would be best to call them by the "Stage" they are currently at: "Stage 2 Decorators", or just simply the "Decorators Proposal".

The reasoning is that saying "ES7 Decorators" assumes that Decorators is expected to be in ES7. I mentioned this in my [last post regarding compiling node_modules](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/06/26/on-consuming-and-publishing-es2015+-packages#staging-process), but being in a particular Stage doesn't guarantee much: a proposal can stall, move backward, or get removed entirely.

We wanted to highlight this fact when we decided to [change the names](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration#switch-to-proposal-for-tc39-proposals-blog-2017-12-27-nearing-the-70-releasehtml-renames-proposal) of the proposal plugins from `@babel/plugin-transform-` to `@babel/plugin-proposal-`.

What are we to do here? It does feel like part of our responsibility to make speaking about these proposals clear.

### Back and Forth

Over the years, we've had many issues raised in our repo about what to do with the Stage presets: [#4914](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/4914), [#4955](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/4955), [#7770](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7770)

I even wrote in an older post about the release of Babel 7.0 that said we *weren't* [removing them](https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/12/27/nearing-the-7.0-release) ðŸ˜….

Ultimately, we decided that keeping the Stage presets would lead to some issues for Babel itself:

- It was a common issue to ask something like: ["What presets(s) are needed to use async functions?"](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/2948). It was difficult for people to know exactly what `stage-0` meant, and few people would look at its `package.json` or source.
- Removing a plugin in Stage 3 is actually a breaking change. This issue is exacerbated when you are trying to use `@babel/preset-env` to not compile a natively supported proposal.

### BabelScript

[TC39](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) urges caution when using Stage 2-or below proposals, as it might result in inadvertant pressure from the community to keep the implementation as-is instead of improving/changing it for fear of breaking existing code or fragmentation (for example, using a different symbol like `#` for decorators instead of `@`). 

People joke that developers that use Babel are using "BabelScript" instead of JavaScript, implying that somehow once a Babel plugin is made for a certain feature, that must mean itâ€™s "fixed" or officially part of the language already (which is not true). For some, the first question that people think of when they see a new syntax or idea (Stage -1 ðŸ˜‚) is whether there's a Babel plugin for it.

Having presets for proposals so early in the process may imply to people that these proposals are guaranteed to move forward or have a stable implementation.

### Setting Expectations

After compilers like Babel made it common practice for people to write ES2015, it was natural for developers to want to try out even newer and more experimental "features". The way this worked in Babel was to use the `stage` flag in previous versions or the `stage-x` presets.

Being the most convenient way of opting into any new feature, it quickly became the default for people when configuring Babel (even though in Babel v6 it moved to not doing anything by default, which caused lots of complaints).

It became common to see `"stage-0"` being used in libraries, boilerplates, talks, tweets, and slides.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Just say no&quot; to `babel?stage=0` in production.</p>&mdash; Ryan Florence (@ryanflorence) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/627154904302288897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2015</a></blockquote>

There was a lot of good discussion even years ago, but it wasn't the easiest thing to navigate: we wouldn't want to penalize users that understood the tradeoffs by putting `console.warn`s when using it, and not having the option at all seemed unreasonable at the time.

Blindly opting into Stage 0 (whether we had it by default) or people choosing to do so seems dangerous, but also never using any proposals is overly cautious. Ideally, everyone should able to make an informed decision about the kinds of features that seem reasonable to them and use them wisely, regardless of what stage they are in. [Mike Pennisi](https://twitter.com/jugglinmike) wrote [a great post](https://bocoup.com/blog/javascript-developers-watch-your-language) about these concerns.

It isn't our intention to threaten, rush, or force specific things into the ecosystem or JavaScript but to faithfully maintain the implementation/discussions around new ideas.

## Hesitations

### Other Considerations

We also could of tried to:

- [Rename the presets](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/4914) to better signify the stability level (doesn't solve the versioning problem)
- Better versioning strategies: independently version the presets and update them immediately when needed, maybe use `0.x`
- Warn/Error for old out of date versions of presets.

The the end, people would still have to look up what proposals are at what Stage to know which ones to use if we kept the Stages in.

### Why Now?

Why not remove it earlier? Stage presets have been part of Babel for years and there were concerns with adding more "complexity" to using Babel. A lot of tooling, documentation, articles, and knowledge were around the Stage presets. We also thought it was better to have officially maintained presets, since someone would (and will) inevitably create them.

We're trying to determine the right level of feedback: if it's only the committee that decides what goes into the language,  it may lead to well-specified features that are not needed, but if the community expects that in-progress, experimental proposals are considered stable or ok to use in production without consequence, then we have other issues. We all want to move forward and proceed with intention: not rushing, but not being too cautious. Babel is the right place to do that experimentation but knowing where the boundaries are is necessary.

In the end, it actually makes more sense to remove the presets because it means that users have to explicitly opt-in to using new proposals. This would be considered a "feature" since it means someone would have to make an explicit decision to use each proposal, which is reasonable for any proposal since they all have varying levels of instability, usefulness, and complexity.

We fully expect some initial backlash from this, but ultimately feel like removing the Stage presets is a better decision for us all in the long run.

And this project is no stranger to community uproar ðŸ™‚, as Babel 6 was a "controversial" release for many. There were plently of posts right after and even [recently](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11371906) that speak about how difficult it was to use.

But removing previous defaults or removing the Stage presets doesn't mean we don't care about ease of use, new users, or documentation. We try with what we can to keep the project stable, document what we know, and provide tooling to make things better.

## Migrating

> For a more automatic migration, we have updated [babel-upgrade](https://github.com/babel/babel-upgrade) to do this for you (you can run `npx babel-upgrade`).

The TL;DR is that we removing the Stage presets. At some level, people will have to opt-in and know what kinds of proposals are being used instead of assuming what people should use, especially given the unstable nature of some of these proposals. But if you use your another preset or a toolchain (i.e. [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) it's possible this change doesn't affect you directly.

We have deprecated the Stage presets as of `7.0.0-beta.52`, so if you don't want to change your config now we would suggest you *pin* the versions to `beta.54` until you can upgrade; after `beta.54` we will throw an error with a message saying how to migrate.

As as alternative, you are free to make your own preset that contains the same plugins and upgrade them as you please (someone make a tool that automatically creates a preset from your config). In the future, we may want to work on a `babel-init` that can help you setup plugins interactively or update `babel-upgrade` itself to accomplish it. Maybe Babel should stay as a low-level tool and rely on other higher-level/framework tools like `create-react-app` to handle these choices for people.

## The Future

### Proposal Implementations in Babel

[Josh Justice](https://twitter.com/CodingItWrong) wrote a [post](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/19/whats-happening-with-the-pipeline-proposal) recently about the changes to using the pipeline operator (`|>`).

The main point there is that the proposal itself is in flux and has a few options to explore. Because we'd like to implement all three of the current possibilities as Babel plugins for both spec feedback and user feedback, we believed the way the plugin is used should change as well.

Before we would simply add the proposal plugin to the config and that was it. Now we would remove the default behavior and ask users to opt-in to a flag that shows which proposal is chosen, and makes it clear that there isn't a fixed or even favored option at the moment.

```diff
{
  "plugins": [
-   "@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator"
+   ["@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator", { "proposal": "minimal" }]
  ]
}
```

### Ecosystem Maintenance Burden

TODO: Each new syntax provides affordances to the language, but it brings new burdens for all of our tooling. Can mention all the tooling that needs to be updated along the way and the lack of help. https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/619580016473456641, http://jshint.com/blog/new-lang-features/

### Purpose

TODO: We are trying to better position ourselves in the JavaScript ecosystem: being part of the TC39 process and being a resource for both implementing newer (Stage 0-2) proposals and receiving feedback from users.
