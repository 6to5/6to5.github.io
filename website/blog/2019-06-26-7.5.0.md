Today we are releasing Babel 7.5.0!

This release includes improved support for a few ECMAScript proposals: in particular "F#" variant of the Stage 1 pipeline operator  and now an official plugin for the Stage 4 dynamic `import()` proposal (along with `preset-env` support).
It also has experimental support for TypeScript `namespace`s and for Browserslist's `default` query in `preset-env`.

You can read the whole changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.5.0).

Thanks to [Wesley Wolfe](https://github.com/Wolvereness), [Martin Zl√°mal](https://github.com/mrtnzlml), [Blaine Bublitz](https://github.com/phated), [Letladi Sebesho](https://github.com/Letladi), and [Paul Comanici](https://github.com/darkyndy) for their first PRs!

We are always looking for help, especially with triaging issues, reviewing pull requests and helping people on Slack. We are experimenting with the new [triage](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-05-23-triage-and-maintain-roles-beta/) role implemented by GitHub, and we want to recognize people people from the community who will stand up helping us! üòâ

Thus we also want to welcome our newest addition to the Babel organization: [Tan Li Hau](https://github.com/tanhauhau)! Li Hau has been a great help in constantly triaging issues and fixing bugs; please check out his [blog](https://lihautan.com/blogs) and follow him on Twitter ([@lihautan](https://twitter.com/lihautan)).

Our work has made been possible also by our sponsors. We want to thank both [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) and [clay](https://clay.global) for becoming Silver Sponsors on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/babel), as well as [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com) for becoming a Silver Sponsor of Henry on GitHub!

If you or your company want to support Babel and the evolution of JavaScript, but aren't sure how, you can sponsor us on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/babel) and, better yet, work with us on the implementation of [new ECMAScript proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals) directly! As a volunteer-driven project, we rely on the community's support to both fund our efforts in supporting the wide range of JavaScript users and taking ownership of the code. Reach out to [Henry](https://twitter.com/left_pad) if you'd like to talk more!

## Highlights

### F# pipeline operator ([#9450](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/9450) and [#9984](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/9984))

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The pipeline operator proposal is still at Stage 1, and thus its specification is still being defined.

This [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator) has a few variants that are being thought out. By testing this plugin, you can help the proposal authors gather feedback about how pipelines could work. But also note that refactoring will be required if the semantics change throughout the proposal process (and they will).

Since version 7.3.0, Babel supported the ["Smart" variant](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/wiki#proposal-4-smart-mix) of the pipeline operator proposal, and the ["minimal" variant](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/wiki#proposal0-original-minimal-proposal) since 7.0.0-beta. 

Thanks to the joint efforts of [Thiago Arrais](https://twitter.com/thiagoarrais) and [James DiGioia](https://twitter.com/JamesDiGioia), you can now also test the ["F#" variant](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/wiki#proposal-1-f-sharp-style-only-with-await)! If you have thoughts or comments about this specific proposal variant, you can reach out to [James](https://twitter.com/JamesDiGioia).

How is the "F#" variant different from the "Smart" one? It doesn't have the concept of "topic references" (`#`), instead you can easily use arrow functions. This has the advantage of being more similar to current JavaScript, at the cost of a slighly less concise syntax.

<table class="danger-force-code-no-wrap">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Current JavaScript</th>
      <th>F# pipeline</th>
      <th>Smart pipeline</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>

<!-- DO NOT indent this table, or the code won't be highlighted -->
<td>

```js
let newScore = boundScore(
  0,
  100,
  add(7, double(person.score))  
);
```
</td>

<td>

```js
let newScore = person.score
  |> double
  |> n => add(7, n)
  |> n => boundScore(0, 100, n);

```
</td>

<td>

```js
let newScore = person.score
  |> double
  |> add(7, #)
  |> boundScore(0, 100, #);     

```
</td>

</tr>
</table>

Although the two proposals aren't dependent on one another or being developed as a single proposal, you can use F# pipelines alongside with partial application (supported since Babel 7.4.0):
```javascript
let newScore = person.score
  |> double
  |> add(7, ?)
  |> boundScore(0, 100, ?);
```

Note that, while it may look the same as the "Smart" pipeline variant, the partial application proposal only supports `?` in function call parameters. This means that, for example, `person |> #.score` is a valid "Smart" pipeline whose F# equivalent must use an arrow function: `person |> p => p.score`.

The F# pipeline operator is also different regarding how `await` is handled:

<table class="danger-force-code-no-wrap">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Current JavaScript</th>
      <th>F# pipeline</th>
      <th>Smart pipeline</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>

<!-- DO NOT indent this table, or the code won't be highlighted -->
<td>

```js
let id = (
  await (
    await fetch(url)     
  ).json()
).ID;
```
</td>

<td>

```js
let newScore = fetch(url)
  |> await
  |> r => r.json()
  |> await
  |> obj => obj.ID;
```
</td>

<td>

```js
let newScore = fetch(url)
  |> await #
  |> #.json()
  |> await #
  |> #.ID;
```
</td>

</tr>
</table>

If you want to test this new proposal variant, you can add `@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator` to your babel configuration:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ["@babel/proposal-pipeline-operator", { proposal: "fsharp" }]
  ]
};
```
You can also try it out in the [repl](https://babeljs.io/repl/version/%5E7.5.0#?presets=stage-1), by enabling the "Stage 1" preset.

### Dynamic import ([#9552](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/9552) and [#10109](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10109))

Although Babel has had support for parsing dynamic imports `import(source)` for a long time, there hasn't been a consistent way of transforming it.
- If you used `webpack` or `rollup`, you would only include `@babel/plugin-syntax-dinamic-import` and not transform it with Babel.
- If you used Node, you could use the [`babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node`](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node/) plugin to transform it.
- If you used SystemJS, `@babel/plugin-transform-modules-systemjs` in conjunction with `@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import` transformed it without explicitly enabling a transform plugin for `import()`.

Since the dynamic import proposal has been recently merged to the main specification, we have decided to unify those plugins under a single entry point: `@babel/plugin-proposal-dynamic-import`. This plugin must be used alongisde with one of the module transform plugins, because Babel needs to know which modules loading system you are targeting. When targeting CommonJS, it internally delegates to [`babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node`](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node/).

For example, this is a valid configuration:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-dynamic-import",
    "@babel/plugin-transform-modules-amd"
  ]
};
```

While this isn't:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-dynamic-import"
  ]
};
```

If you want to only allow parsing of `import()` expressions without transforming them, you can just include the `@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import` package.

If you are using `@babel/preset-env`, dynamic import support will be enabled by default. You don't need to worry about `webpack` or `rollup` support, since `babel-loader` and `rollup-plugin-babel` will automatically disable the Babel transform to let the bundler handle it correctly.

### `defaults` browserlist query in `@babel/preset-env` ([#8897](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/8897))

By default `@babel/preset-env` runs every syntax transform on your code, making it compatible with ECMAScript engines. This often leads to unnecessary transforms, not needed for most browsers.

For this reason, Babel users should always ask themselves which browsers they want to support or their constraints (e.g. `> 5%, not IE`). Browserslist, the library `@babel/preset-env` uses to decode your targets, can help with this decision by providing [sensisble default choices](https://browserl.ist/?q=defaults). 

You can use it in Babel like this:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ["@babel/preset-env", {
      targets: { browsers: "defaults" }
    }]
  ]
};
```

You can also set it using a `.browserslistrc` file, which is also used by other tools like Autoprefixer or Stylelint.

The default behavior of `@babel/preset-env` is still to compile everything, but we might switch it in Babel 8 to use this `defaults` query.

### Experimental TypeScript `namespaces` support ([#9785](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/9785))

> Maybe it will be in v7.6.0?

Until now, [namespaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html) were the second biggest TypeScript feature not supported by Babel (the first one is type-checking! üòõ). Thanks to the work done by community member [Wesley Wolfe](https://twitter.com/wolvereness), you can now enable _experimental_ support for them in the TypeScript plugin, using the `allowNamespaces` option of `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ["@babel/plugin-transform-typescript", {
      allowNamespaces: true
    }]
  ]
}
```

Then, you can use namespaces in your code:

```javascript
namespace Validation {
  const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;
  const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;

  export class LettersOnlyValidator {
    isAcceptable(s: string) {
      return lettersRegexp.test(s);
    }
  }
}
```

> #### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
>
> TypeScript namespaces can't be properly transpiled by Babel, since they need some type information that only a full TypeScript compiler and type-checker can provide. The TypeScript/Babel didn't think it was priority or that Babel should drastically change to support the feature so it wasn't implemented in the initial launch of TS support.
> 
> For this reason, the current support has some limitations:
> - Namespaces can only export immutable bindings
> - When merging multiple namespaces with the same name, their scope isn't shared
> 
> You can find the full list of caveats in the `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript` [documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript#caveats).
