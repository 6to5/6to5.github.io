Create a new project configuration (i.e. config.js):

```sh
$ jspm init
```
when asked which transiler you would like to use:

> Which ES6 transpiler would you like to use, Traceur or Babel? [traceur]:

Type Babel and press enter.


Note: * **Transpiler**: Change this option at any time with `jspm dl-loader --babel`. Custom transpilation options can also be set through `babelOptions` or `traceurOptions` in the jspm config file.
