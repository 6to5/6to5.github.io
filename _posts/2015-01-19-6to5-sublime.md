We are pleased to announce <a href="https://github.com/6to5/6to5-sublime/" target="_blank">6to5-sublime</a>, a set of language syntax definitions for modern JavaScript with JSX extensions, as well as snippets for common React constructs (like lifecycle methods) in ES6. It's available as <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/6to5" target="_blank">6to5</a> on <a href="https://packagecontrol.io" target="_blank">Package Control</a>. Eliminating barriers to ES6+ adoption is not just about having the most feature-ready transpiler – it's also about providing the right environment in which to write ES6+ JavaScript.

Under the hood, 6to5-sublime is based on the excellent <a href="https://github.com/Benvie/JavaScriptNext.tmLanguage" target="_blank">Benvie/JavaScriptNext.tmLanguage</a> project with JSX syntax support built on top. We've added many improvements over <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/sublime-react/">sublime-react</a>, including support for JSX namespaces and comments between JSX attributes.
