We are pleased to announce [6to5-sublime](https://github.com/6to5/6to5-sublime/), a set of language syntax definitions for modern JavaScript with JSX extensions, as well as snippets for common React constructs (like lifecycle methods) in ES6. It's available as [6to5](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/6to5) on [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io). Eliminating barriers to ES6+ adoption is not just about having the most feature-ready transpiler – it's also about providing the right environment in which to write ES6+ JavaScript.

Under the hood, 6to5-sublime is based on the excellent [Benvie/JavaScriptNext.tmLanguage](https://github.com/Benvie/JavaScriptNext.tmLanguage) project with JSX syntax support built on top. We've added many improvements over [sublime-react](https://github.com/reactjs/sublime-react/), including support for JSX namespaces and comments between JSX attributes.
